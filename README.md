## **Project Overview**

Aurora is an AI-powered career navigation platform designed to solve Bangladesh's critical graduate underemployment problem. By analyzing a user's profile against the demands of the job market, Aurora provides a personalized roadmap to bridge the skills gap.

The application is built with a modular, three-part architecture—**Benchmark**, **Elevate**, and **Ace**—all of which are fully functional and powered by live AI.

## **Key Features**

* **Benchmark Module:** A powerful diagnostic engine that analyzes a user's CV against a live job description to generate a detailed "Skill Gap Report."
* **Elevate Module:** A personalized learning co-pilot that takes a user's identified skill gaps and generates a custom learning path with course recommendations.
* **Ace Module:** An AI interview coach that generates tailored interview questions based on a job description to help users practice and prepare.

## **Technology Stack**

* **AI Development Partners:** This project was built with the assistance of **Google Gemini** and **Grok**.
* **Backend:** Python
* **Frontend & UI:** Gradio
* **Core AI:** Live Analysis via Google Gemini API
* **Libraries:** PyPDF2

## **Future Roadmap**

The vision for Aurora extends beyond the current version. Key future developments include:

* **Custom API Backend:** Development of a high-performance API backend is planned to enable greater scalability and faster analysis.
* **Interactive Voice Mode (Ace):** A voice mode is under development to enable smooth, realistic mock interviews, allowing users to speak their answers directly to the AI.
* **Enhanced Learning Tools (Elevate):** More features for personalized learning will be added, such as tools for generating custom mindmaps and study schedules.
